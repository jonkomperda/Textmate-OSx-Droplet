Textmate-OSx-Droplet
====================

This is a droplet that allows you to open the current finder window in textmate by clicking on it. It also supports dragging individual or multiple files over the logo in order to open them in textmate.

VERY IMPORTANT!
---------------
You MUST have a working copy of [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) installed with symlinks available from the terminal. Easiest way to check is to open terminal and type 'mate', if it opens, then all is well. If not, go into preferences and make the link.
